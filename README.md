## Overview

Aide leverages transformer-based architectures to enhance natural language processing capabilities:

### Transformers

- **Architecture Overview**: Transformers use attention mechanisms to process sequential data, optimizing text analysis and response generation.
- **Integration with GPT Models**: Aide integrates with pre-trained models like GPT from OpenAI for accurate and context-aware interactions.

### Web Scraping with Cheerio

- **Description**: Cheerio is used to provide web scraping functionality within Aide, enabling the extension to extract and interact with content from web pages.
- **Usage**: Cheerio parses the HTML of web pages, allowing Aide to manipulate and extract information efficiently.

## Fine-Tuning and Customization

Aide allows fine-tuning of its AI models using the following parameters to customize behavior and outputs:

### Fine-Tuning Parameters that can be used to customise the response from the model.

#### 1. Temperature

- **Description**: Controls the randomness of the model's outputs.
- **Range**: Typically ranges from 0 to 1.
- **Constraint**: 
  - A value of 0 results in deterministic outputs, always choosing the most probable token.
  - Higher values introduce more randomness, leading to more diverse but potentially less accurate outputs.

#### 2. Top K

- **Description**: Limits the number of possible next words the model considers at each step.
- **Range**: Integer value, typically set between 1 and the vocabulary size.
- **Constraint**: 
  - Setting a lower value ensures the model only considers the most probable tokens, improving output stability.
  - Higher values increase diversity but may introduce less common or less relevant tokens.

#### 3. Top P (Nucleus Sampling)

- **Description**: Limits the probability distribution over possible words.
- **Range**: Typically a probability value between 0 and 1.
- **Constraint**: 
  - Lower values restrict the token sampling to the most likely choices, ensuring safer and more predictable outputs.
  - Higher values allow for a wider range of token choices, potentially including more creative or less probable outputs.

#### 4. Num Context

- **Description**: Specifies the number of previous conversation exchanges considered.
- **Range**: Integer value, indicating the depth of context considered.
- **Constraint**: 
  - Higher values provide more context to the model, potentially improving coherence and relevance in conversational interactions.
  - However, increasing Num Context can also increase computational load and response latency.

#### 5. Seed

- **Description**: Random number used to initialize the model's internal state.
- **Range**: Any integer value.
- **Constraint**: 
  - Using the same seed ensures deterministic outputs for the same input, facilitating reproducibility and debugging.
  - Different seeds generate different outputs even for the same input, useful for exploring diverse responses or creative applications.

## How to Use Effectively

- **Factual Accuracy**: Use a lower Temperature and adjust Top K and Top P to prioritize safe, predictable outputs.
- **Creativity**: Increase Temperature for more diverse and creative outputs, while adjusting Top K and Top P to balance novelty with relevance.
- **Conversational Contexts**: Increase Num Context to maintain coherence and relevance across multiple exchanges.
- **Consistency vs. Variability**: Use Seed to control the variability of outputs, ensuring consistency or exploring diverse responses based on application needs.
